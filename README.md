PC(python calculator)

I made an interactive calculator for command line that formats the equation nicely.

It's pretty much a frontend to the python interpreter for mathematical purposes.

It was a pain to figure out and likely has some glitches that I'll need to resolve, 
but I'm happy that I finally made it after the struggle.

The name is a pun on the CLI calculator bc and is pretty basic. I literally use python's
eval to do the math because I don't want to deal with precedence rules for my parser that
I noticed are pretty glitchy. Like I said, it uses eval making it pretty blatantly insecure
and kinda dangerous and that's mostly why I added the license.
